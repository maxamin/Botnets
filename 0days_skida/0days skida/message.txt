This video is about some exploit bullshit thats been going around and also a 0day i was scammed for

[?] INFO ABOUT EXPLOITS [?]

#oem/oemshell# - fake 0day
-This exploit is supposed to effect tvt oem but, was resolved march of 2018
-only older tvt oem are effected but this exploit trys to infect anything with the port open
-it also doesn't infect every device it displays it just says infected if they page has 200 anywhere in it
-which would include if the site displayed an error that has 200 in it EX. nfiuhwqig200fiuhs87
-the method that is trys to inject commands is also resolved so you will not be able to infect devices

#ipcam#
-This exploit uses a pretty well known command line injection method
-getting the devices in bulk is next to impossible without ranges which i never got
-cgi-bin/ddns_enc.cgi is the file it abuses to give you access
-i was givin this one because oem wasn't 0day and it's ass
